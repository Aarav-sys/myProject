                </h1></div>
                <p>Hello, my name is Aarav Shrivastava and I was born on 22nd July, 2008 in Bangalore. I have stayed in Bangalore for 10 years and finished my primary studies over there till 5th grade. At the end of January 2019, I shifted to Gurgaon as my dad got promoted to a new company. Also, we shifted to Gurgaon because I used to stay seperately from my dad when I used to stay in Bangalore and we took a plan of staying together instead of staying seperately. After shifting to Gurgaon, I continued my 5th Grade in a school called Pathways School Gurgaon. I am currently studying in 7th grade.
